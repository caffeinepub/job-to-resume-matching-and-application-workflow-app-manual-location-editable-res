  "summary": "Diff adds a Motoko backend actor with per-user resume/location storage, job postings, job matching, and application entities, plus a frontend UI for authentication, resume/cover letter/location editors, jobs list/detail, and an apply flow. Some required behaviors (job editing, sorting by match score, and recording 'Go to Application' link-open events) are not evidenced in the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "JobDetail opens the application URL in a new tab, and calls ensureApplication(), but no explicit backend call to record a 'link opened' event/timestamp is shown in the frontend, and the backend snippet does not show a dedicated function/event for recording link-open actions.",
